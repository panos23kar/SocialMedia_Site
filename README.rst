Social Media Site Project
==========================

About
---------

During this project, I created a Social Media site, where people can create their owns groups, join or leave other people groups and create and publish posts!
The original idea of this project comes from the *Second Clone Project*, which is part of the Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp course of Udemy.
